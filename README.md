Resistance
==========

A web app for playing The Resistance, a game designed by Don Eskridge. Written in Ur/Web, a language for web apps that catches most non-business-logic bugs at compile time.

Current version is very raw (e.g. old games accumulate in the database, there are some strange issues with message passing being slow, etc.) but does actually work!
